    "- Goat city is ordering Covid vaccines and is fully aware that not everyone will get the vaccine. Goat city wants to know how many Covid vaccines they should be ordering. We want to show them that using a survey to predict if a person will get a vaccine is a valid way of estimating how many vaccines to get. \n",

    ">Vaccines for H1N1 were first publicly available in the United States in October 2009, when the United States government began a vaccination campaign. We will look at data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey collected to monitor vaccination rates during that campaign. This phone survey asked people whether they had received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with information they shared about their lives, opinions, and behaviors. A better understanding of how these characteristics have been associated with personal vaccination patterns may provide guidance for future public health efforts.\n",

    "The data has already been split into a train and test set, however, we do not have access to the testing set's labels. For now, our group will be focusing ONLY on the h1n1 vaccine label."
